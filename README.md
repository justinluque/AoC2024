# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions to 2024's Advent of Code puzzles.

# Getting Started
Each day is stored in it's own folder to make easier the storage of input files. Once the specific day has been built the executable is placed in the folder (i.e. `Day1/solution.exe`) and should be ran from the main project folder (i.e. by entering `./Day/solution.exe` in the terminal). If the input file (called `input.txt`) is placed in the correct location (i.e. `Day1/input.txt`) a correct output should be produced.

## Prerequisites

- **C++ compiler** - Should at least support C++20 standard
- [**Make**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) - Not strictly necessary but makes compilation easier

## Building

To test a solution you can run the following (replace the number with the given day you'd like to solve)

```
make day1
```
